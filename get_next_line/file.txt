Build a fire a thousand miles away
To light my long way home
I ride a comet, my trail is long to stay
Silence is a heavy stone
I fight the world and take all they can give
There are times my heart hangs low
Born to walk against the wind, born to hear my name
No matter where I stand, I'm alone
Stand and fight, live by your heart
Always one more try, I'm not afraid to die
Stand and fight, say what you feel
Born with a heart of steel
Burn the bridge behind you, leave no retreat
There's only one way home
Those who laugh and crowd the path, and cut each other's throats
Will fall like melting snow
They'll watch us rise with fire in our eyes
They'll bow their heads, their hearts will hang low
Then we'll laugh and they will kneel
And know this heart of steel
Was too hard to break, too hard to hold
Stand and fight, live by your heart
Always one more try, I'm not afraid to die
Stand and fight, say what you feel
Born with a heart of steel, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Born with a heart of steel
Stand and fight, say what you feel
Born with a heart of steel
Stand and fight, live by your heart
Always one more try, I'm not afraid to die
Stand and fight, say what you feel
Born with a heart of steel
